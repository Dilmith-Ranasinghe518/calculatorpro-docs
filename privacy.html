<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>January 2025</strong></p>

<p>Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>CalculatorPro</strong> handles information when you use our app.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p><strong>CalculatorPro does not collect, store, or share any personal information.</strong></p>
<p>No login, registration, email, or personal identification details are required to use our app.</p>

<h2>2. Information You Enter in the App</h2>
<p>All values entered—such as salary, EPF percentages, gratuity years, unit conversion values—are processed locally on your device. None of these values are sent to any server.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>CalculatorPro uses publicly available APIs to fetch:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Country names and flags (from restcountries.com)</li>
    <li>EPF/ETF data hosted on GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>These services may collect non-personal diagnostic data such as request logs. CalculatorPro does not control or store this information.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
<p>The free version of CalculatorPro may include third-party advertisements (AdMob or similar). These services may collect device identifiers or ad interaction data to improve ad relevance.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> store or access this information.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>Since CalculatorPro does not process or store personal data, risk exposure is minimal. All calculations occur on your device without external transmission.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided information, contact us immediately.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the app means you accept the updated policy.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
