<p>
No login, registration, email address, or personally identifiable information
is required to use this app.
</p>

<h2>2. Information You Enter in the App</h2>
<p>
All values entered into the app (such as salary figures, EPF/ETF percentages,
gratuity years, unit conversion values, or calculator inputs) are processed
locally on your device.

None of this data is transmitted, stored, or shared with external servers.

policies.
